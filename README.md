Minimalistic transactional model core. ES6

Will be the basis for next NestedTypes version.

## Current state

- [x] Basic regression tests passes. Transactional core seems to work.

- [ ] Test it with NestedReact examples.
- [ ] Release ObjectPlus as separate package.
- [ ] Implement classes support in NestedReact.
- [ ] Deploy NestedReact and NestedTypes 2.0 RC to Volicon Observer product.
