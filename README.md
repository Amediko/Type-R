# TransactionalJS

Minimalistic transactional model core. ES6

Will be the basis for next NestedTypes version.

## Current state

- [x] Basic regression tests passes. Transactional core seems to work.
- [x] New integral performance tests shows 2-3 times performance improvement in complex structure updates. Good enough to go further.
- [ ] Launching backbone Model/Collection regression to implement missing core functionality. That's gonna be tough.
- [ ] Implement relations.
- [ ] Implement ValueLinks (?).
- [ ] Implement NestedTypes compatibility layer.
