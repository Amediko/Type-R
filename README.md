# TransactionalJS

Minimalistic transactional model core. ES6

Will be the basis for next NestedTypes version.

## Current state

Basic regression tests passes. Transactional core seems to work.

New integral performance tests shows 2-3 times performance improvement in complex structure updates.

Launching backbone Model/Collection regression to implement missing functionality. That's gonna be tough.
