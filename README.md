# TransactionalJS

Minimalistic transactional model core. ES6

Will be the basis for next NestedTypes version.

## Current state

Detailed design is finished.

NestedTypes 1.3 test harness is deployed and ready to engage. Beware, bugs. Time to code and debug.

We're on the finish line. Lets see what we will got in terms of performance. It should be the real beast in V8, outperforming everything which is written for the data layer up to the date. Magic people, voodoo people! :)
