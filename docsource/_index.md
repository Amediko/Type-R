### Reactive and persistent state

All data objects defined with Type-R
are observable and serializable by default.

Complex serialization scenarios like many-to-many
relations are supported out of box.

### Declarative validation

Validation checks are transparent and defined
as a part of an attributes definition.

### Dynamically type-safe

State elements are _typed_.
It's guaranteed that state elements will
retain declared types at run-time no matter what.

Client-server communication is validated and guarded from
type errors from both ends.
